Hi all,
</p>

<p>
After more than three and a half years in Mexico working at Segundamano Mexico,
I've decided to accept an offer from <a href="https://www.zaleos.net/">Zaleos</a> and come back to Spain. As you may
know, I've been working at Schibsted (the company that owns Segundamano) for
eight years, first in Madrid for four years and a half approximately and later
in Mexico City for the last three and a half years,. This time has been an
amazing time, both personally (I've met some great people, some of them will
remain friends in the future) and professionally (I can't even list all the
things I've learned during this time). But at a certain point, I felt that I
needed a new challenge to keep growing professionally. At the same time, I wanted
to be closer to my family, since we were more than 10000 km away, and that is
where Zaleos comes.
</p>

<p>
Zaleos is a software development company that develops IP based solutions to
provide to the Public Safety sector with the much-needed ability to interface
with multiple sources of data and receive critical, real-time information from
callers in need. I expect to see technologies related to VoIP and real-time
protocols, a full new field for me in the working environment, so don't be
surprised if I start posting entries about real-time protocols :).
</p>

        <p>My name is Pablo Alvarez de Sotomayor Posadillo, and I’m a Free Software activist from Cordoba (Spain). I'm currently living in Mexico City, and I'm currently working on Segundamano Mexico, which it's part of Schibsted Classifieds Media.
In this blog I'll write both technical posts and personal opinions, but I'll try to focus on the technical posts as much as possible. This is my personal blog, so every opinion I write here is my own personal opinion. If you want to know a little more about me you can visit
