  <div class="entry-content"><p>
In the <a href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/palvarez/2011/09/14/spanishrevolution-part-ii/">second part</a> of this post I&#8217;ve explained the recent history and
evolution of the social movements in Spain. In this post I&#8217;m going to
focus in #15m (or Indignados) movement, how they&#8217;ve started, their
proposals, things that, <b>IMHO</b>, they&#8217;ve done well, things to improve
and where they should go.</p>

<p>
As I said in my previous post, Indignados movement has been influenced
by the #nolesvotes movement, which shows both how to self-organize in
a global way (the opposite of the traditional social movements has
done historically, working at a neighborhood level or, at best, at a
city level) and how the new technologies can help in this
self-organization, but, obviously, it&#8217;s not the only movement that has
influenced to #15M.</p>

<p>
In recent years the social movements in Spain have seen a revival in
grassroots organization, whose work in the neighborhoods has been an
essential breeding ground for movement #15M. These grassroots
organizations have a participatory democracy based on people&#8217;s
assemblies and consensus decision making. These horizontally
structured assemblies are completely transparent and open to anyone
who wants to participate. The groundwork has served not only to learn
work techniques and methodologies assemblies, but also enabled them to
know the people, know their concerns and problems and know how to work
with them.</p>

<p>
Therefore, having these two movements as parents it&#8217;s not strange how
quickly this movement has emerged and spread throughout all the country,
in a way that only a few people could imagine.</p>

<p>
On January 2011, the digital platform Democracia real YA (one of the
main actors in #15M movement) was created on Spanish social networks
and forums. Having the support of organisations such as ATTAC,
Intermon Oxfam, Ecologists in Action or Youth without Future, and
using Twitter and Facebook it called &#8220;the unemployed, poorly paid, the
subcontractors, the precarious, young people&#x2026;&#8221; to take the streets
on 15 May in almost every city in Spain (you have at Wikipedia a
comprehensive list of all the places that were called to take the
streets on that day). That same day, small demonstrations in support
of the Spanish ones were organised in Dublin, Lisbon, Amsterdam,
Istanbul, Bologna, London and Paris.</p>

<p>
The first protest was called under the motto &#8220;we are not goods in the
hands of politicians and bankers&#8221; and was focused on opposition to
what the protesters called &#8220;antisocial means in the hands of bankers&#8221;,
partly referring to the changes made in 2010 to contain the ongoing
European sovereign debt crisis through bailout of the banks, which the
Spanish society saw as responsible for the crisis, while at the same
time the government kept announcing social program cutbacks.
Protesters also demanded more democracy, a new electoral law and end
to political corruption as well as other claims, such as banks
nationalisation.</p>

<p>
The main demand of #15M is a radical change in Spanish politics, and,
although #15M is a heterogeneous and ambiguous group, they share a
strong rejection of unemployment, welfare cuts, Spanish politicians,
the current two-party system in Spain between the Spanish Socialist
Workers&#8217; Party and the People&#8217;s Party, as well as the current
political system, capitalism, banks and bankers, political corruption
and firmly support what they call basic rights: home, work, culture,
health and education.</p>

<p>
As #nolesvotes, they don&#8217;t consider themselves to be represented by
any traditional party nor favoured by the measures approved by
politicians. If you want to know more about the #15M proposals and
actions you can visit their <a href="http://movimiento15m.org/">official page</a> and read their <a href="http://movimiento15m.org/manifiesto-movimiento-15m-%C2%A1democracia-real-ya/#more-5">manifesto</a>.</p>

<p>
The impact of #15M has been bigger than anyone thought, because
according to statistics published by RTVE (the Spanish public
broadcasting company) between 6.5 and 8 million Spaniards have
participated in these protests, an unthinkable thing at the beginning
of the year, and in this kind of things you can&#8217;t trust the official
information, so probably the participation has been even more.</p>

<p>
I think the most important thing that this movement has made is to
make the spanish population aware that we can change the actual
situation of our country, because a lot of people didn&#8217;t think they
can do something to make a change.</p>

<p>
Also, I think that #15M can have a life much longer than much people
can imagine, from one side because the changes they are proposing are
big ones, and they need time to define both the changes we have to
make to have a fairly society and the strategy to make this changes
possible, and from the other side because they have reach a big impact
in the population, a lot of people has been a part of #15M, and being
part of a movement like this makes you feel that your contribution is
important, and, although sometimes you can desperate, this is a
feeling that once you have it you want to keep it.</p>

<p>
Seeing the movement from the outside (although I wanted to involve
myself in the movement I couldn&#8217;t find the time until now) I think
that sometimes they&#8217;ve enter in the politician&#8217;s game more than they
needs, but, obviously, it&#8217;s a new and complex situation to handle and
it can&#8217;t be perfect.</p>

<p>
The movement has passed some critical times and situations (like the
time after the local elections or the Pope visit), and they&#8217;ll going
to pass some more critical situations, but I think that the most
important one is to handle the people&#8217;s mood (it&#8217;s a long path and a
lot of people can desperate).</p>

<p>
Finally, although the movement can end in nothing, I think that the
process is very important, not only because we&#8217;re trying to change
important thinks, but also because we are changing the point of view
of a lot of people that, until now, they didn&#8217;t realize they can make
a change, and this is the seed of future revolutions.</p>

¡Buenas a todos desde Brasil!</p>

<p>
Hace algunos días descubrí una herramienta que me puede ayudar a
bloguear con bastante más frecuencia, Org2Blog. Es básicamente un
plugin del paquete org para publicar posts desde ficheros org con
emacs. No he usado anteriormente org-mode, asi que he estado
investigando un poco y he podido comprobar que no es sólo un paquete
para publicar entradas en el blog, sino que además es una herramienta
para administrar tu agenda y tu lista de cosas poor hacer, así que he
estado unos días configurándolo y me da la impresión de que lo voy a
usar bastante y me va a ser de gran ayuda.</p>

<p>
La parte de blog parece ser bastante sencilla, porque puedes definir
el post con unas cuantas etiquetas sencillas de recordar y no define
ningún formato extraño para escribir el post (como hacen muchos
wikis). Tu sólo te tienes que ocupar de escribir el post en texto
<b>plano</b> y el paquete se las arregla para convertirlo en tu entrada html.</p>

<p>
Aunque creo que se puede usar para otros blogs distintos de Wordpress,
te recomiendo que mires que paquete funciona mejor para tu blog (por
ejemplo, para blogger hay un paquete que parece funcionar mejor que
este) antes de intentar volverte loco configurando este.</p>

<p>
Una de las cosas que quiero probar en los próximos días es la
integración con Atom, ya que esa integración se hace con otro paquete
y hasta ahora no he conseguido hacerlo funcionar.</p>

<p>
Espero poder bloguear mucho mas con esta herramienta, porque una de
las cosas que odio de los blogs es tener que estar conectado y con un
navegador abierto para escribir una entrada.</p>

<p>
Happy Hacking!</p>

Hi from Brasil!</p>

<p>
Some days ago I&#8217;ve discovered a tool that can help me to blog more
frequently, Org2Blog. It&#8217;s basically a plugin for the org package to
publish posts from org files in emacs. I didn&#8217;t used previously
org-mode, so I&#8217;ve investigated a bit about it and I found that I can
use it not only for blog posting, but also to manage your agenda and
todo list, so I&#8217;ve configured it out and I think I&#8217;m going to use it a
lot.</p>

<p>
The blogging part seems to be pretty easy, because you can define your
post entry with a few and easy to remember tags and it doesn&#8217;t define
any weird format to write (like a lot of wiki pages). You only have to
write your post in <b>plain</b> text and the package manage to convert it
to your html entry.</p>

<p>
Although I think you can use it not only for Wordpress, I recomend you
to search for other packages if you&#8217;re using other blog engine (for
example, there is a package that works better with blogger that seems to work
better than this one).</p>

<p>
One of the thinks that I want to try in the next few days is the
integration of org2blog with atom. This integration is made by other
package and I couldn&#8217;t do it work in the last days.</p>

<p>
I hope to blog much more with this tool, cause one of the things that
I hate of blogging is the necessity of being connected and with a
browser opened to post an entry.</p>

<p>
Happy Hacking!</p>

In the <a href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/palvarez/2011/08/19/spanishrevolution-part-i/">first part</a> of this post I&#8217;ve explained the economical situation
of Spain and how we&#8217;ve reached this situation. Now it&#8217;s the turn to
explain a little bit the origins of the Indignados movement ant the
recent history of the social movements in Spain.</p>

<p>
The Indignados movement (or #15M) born officially the 15 of May of
2011, although I think the real begining started before. In order to
understand better the origins of the #15M it&#8217;s better to explain a
little bit the recent phistory of the social movements in Spain.</p>

<p>
As you might know, before the actual democracy Spain was headed by
Francisco Franco, a dictator aligned ideologically with Hitler. Some
years before his dead (1975) the social movements in Spain begans to
be very strong, and, although they had to be subversive (the
government was very represive even after the dead of Franco), they
gain a lot of popularity, specially in the young people.</p>

<p>
After 1975 and during the 80&#8217;s Spain became into a cultural and
political revolution, and a lot of political parties (included PSOE
and the Comunist Party) and labor unions (CCOO, UGT, CNT, &#x2026;) were
legalized. This was the golden epoch of the social movements in Spain,
because a lot of people were conscious that it was important to be
part of the (not only) political change that was happening in Spain
and, a very important thing, they were a part of this changes, in part
because the government were taking them into consideration and making
changes in the way the social movements were saying.</p>

<p>
After that, during the final 80s and the 90s the political parties
forgot about the people and began to govern for themselves and for the
&#8220;markets&#8221; (a.k.a the rich people) and the social movements began to
accommodate, partially because the social situation were much better
than during the dictatorial period and partially because some state
mechanisms made the social movements too dependents from the
government charity, and in the moment that any organization depends
on the government it has to do some things and leave to do other
things to please them and survive.</p>

<p>
I think that the reaction to this circumstances come both from a new
social movement surged in Spain (and in the world :)), the Free
Software movement, that has become very strong sice the final 90s, and
from the deterioration of the spanish life style, specially with the
actual crisis environment.</p>

<p>
In the last years we&#8217;ve seen here in Spain a lot of movement against
the software patents in Europe and agains some copyright laws that
have emerged in the last years in Spain, and a big part of this
movement has been lead by hacktivist that have been participated in
the Free Software movement during several years.</p>

<p>
This movements have been organized dinamically, without a need of a
phisical organization, and in several times during a specific period
of time. This has made that the state, with his old mechanisms of
working, couldn&#8217;t stop this kind of organization, that have made the
enough noise to influence again in the political life of the country
and in the spanish people.</p>

<p>
This was the kind of organization of #nolesvotes, the father of
the #15m (or indignados) movement, who asks to vote in the municipal
elections to any party but PSOE or PP, rised after the approval of an
unfair copyright law by the two main political parties of
Spain. Because of that #nolesvotes gained the support and/or
comprehension of the population, being, in my point of view, a big
success.</p>

<p>
To be continued&#x2026;</p>
