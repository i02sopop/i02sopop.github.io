For those you don't know, Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It works natively with Docker to make easy both to deploy new versions of your app and scale them. Although it was originally developed by Google (based on their internal project Borg), now is one of the most important projects for deployment projects with Apache Mesos and several of the big software companies apport to the project. One of the things I like of the project is that is quite easy to setup a Kubernetes cluster in different environments (you can use it in the cloud on AWS and Google Cloud or in local with tools like minikube), and you can manage it both with a web interface or in the terminal, make it easier to make scripts to deploy new versions of your application. The interface and commands seems to be quite easy to use, and the configurations, defined in yaml, are also quite straightforward to use. I particularly like how they give you the possibility of defining secrets for your application, so you can have the general configurations on your repository/docker image and keep safe your secrets. The only thing that, for now, I've missed is the possibility to define the number of nodes of your application based on the resources of your application in each moment, instead of changing the number of nodes by hand when you need it. Maybe it's a functionality that is already there, but until now I didn't see the option. There are examples on how to use Kubernetes for several applications, like wordpress, postgresql (with one master and one or several slaves), ..., so it shouldn't be too complicated to set your own configurations for your project. I've planned to play more with Kubernetes, so as soon as I have some examples to show I'll post them in here.

So, if you want to see your changes locally you have to run jekyll serve. </p> <p> One of the things that I think they have enhace in Octopress 3 is the publishing management, because, instead of using Rake as with Octopress 2, they provide a ruby command to manage all that, providing octopress new {post|page|draft} to generate a new post, page or draft and octopress {publish|unpublish} to publish a draft or unpublish a post, so the management of posts is now more easier from my point of view. Finally, with octopress deploy you can deploy your changes to the final destination (github, another git repo, rsync, S3, &#x2026;). </p> <p> You can have more information about Octopress 3 and Jekyll in the <a href="https://github.com/octopress/octopress">Octopress 3 github page</a> and in the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll project page</a>. So, now that I have my blog again working and linked with org-octopress I hope I can write more often. </p> <p> Happy Hacking. </p> ]]></content:encoded> <dc:date>2016-06-10T00:05:00-05:00</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>Make tests on Android projects III</title> <link>http://blog.ritho.net/2013/10/26/android-testing-III/</link> <description><![CDATA[ Hi all! ]]></description> <pubDate>Sat, 26 Oct 2013 18:56:00 -0500</pubDate> <guid>http://blog.ritho.net/2013/10/26/android-testing-III/</guid> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Hi all!</p> <p> I had prepared the next entry of the Android testing tutorial, but I've found a <a href="http://www.vogella.com/articles/AndroidTesting/article.html">tutorial</a> that explains everything about it, even some of the projects that improve the Android test environment, so I've decided not reinvent the wheel and stop this tutorial.

During this year the testing on android has evolved a little bit and now we can see projects, like robotium, that, although they have some errors and features not (well) covered, helps you a lot in the testing process. Said that, let's start!</p> <p> The first step to test an android application (apart from having the code of the android application, of course) is create a test project. For that we are going to use the command line, mainly because, although you can use very complete graphical editors that helps you to do much of the process automatically, I think it's important to know where the things come from and why the things work in that way. So, the command line to create the test project (as we can check <a href="https://developer.android.com/tools/testing/testing_otheride.html">here</a>) is:</p> <p> $ android create test-project -m &lt;main-path&gt; -n &lt;project-name&gt; -p &lt;test-path&gt;</p> <p> Where main-path is the path to the project of the application under test, project-name is the name of the test project (not the name of the main project) and test-path is the directory where the test project is going to be located. A test project depends on the android project that is testing, so is going to compile against this project, recompiling (with a little bit of luck) all the source files of the original project that needs to (re)compile, that's why we need to indicate the path of the main project under test.</p> <p> That also means that a test project is going to test only one application at a time, but it can be updated to change the path of the main project for the case you want to test another project with the same test project (for example, if you have two projects of the same application, one for a free version and other for a premium version, or if you have a base test project that you want to adapt to new applications).</p> <p> The test project doesn't need to be located in any specific directory, so you can place it wherever you want in your filesystem, but take care if you move the test project and you've defined a relative path to the main project, because you'd need to update it.</p> <p> If you check the test project just created, you can see that it haves the same directory structure and build file contents as regular Android application project. That's because it's an actual Android application that use the testing and instrumentation framework and depends on other application to run (like an application that use a library).</p> <p> The test framework is an extension of the JUnit test framework that adds access to the Android system objects to test them, and the instrumentation framework is who actually execute the tests, starting the application at the beginning of each test suite, shutting down the application once the test suite is finished and who runs test by test of each test suite.</p> <p> Well, that's enough for today. In the next post I'll explain the compilation process of a test project (checking the options at the compilation files) and how to run both on test in particular and all the tests of the test project. In that way you can see the basic structure of a test.</p> <p> <b>To be continued&#x2026;</b></p> ]]></content:encoded> <dc:date>2013-09-22T19:49:00-05:00</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>I'm Back!</title> <link>http://blog.ritho.net/2013/09/17/back/</link> <description><![CDATA[ Hi all! ]]></description> <pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2013 18:42:00 -0500</pubDate> <guid>http://blog.ritho.net/2013/09/17/back/</guid> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Hi all!</p> <p> I know it hass been more than a year without writing anything, but, between my absorving work and the fact that I'm not really good with the written world (and a little bit of lazyness, why no admit it), I didn't found the time to dedicate to the blog.</p> <p> Now I'm not going to give promises, but I'm going to try it hard to write at least one post per week, and who knows, maybe once I've started to write I can write more often and more fluently.</p> <p> Well, you'll have notices from me during this week.</p> <p> Happy Hacking!</p> ]]></content:encoded> <dc:date>2013-09-17T18:42:00-05:00</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>Make tests on Android projects I</title> <link>http://blog.ritho.net/2012/05/01/android-testing/</link> <description><![CDATA[ Hi all! ]]></description> <pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2012 21:45:00 -0500</pubDate> <guid>http://blog.ritho.net/2012/05/01/android-testing/</guid> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Hi all!</p> <p> As you might know if you follow my blog I'm working at Schibsted, and one of the projects we are developing is an Android application to access to the classifieds websites of the company (like custojusto.pt, bomnegocio.com, tori.fi, &#x2026;). One of the ideas that defines our work method, Extreme Programming, is the continuous integration of the new developments (or iterations) of the project, so we have to include tests on every project we have in order to check the backward compatibility, and the Android project is not an exception.</p> <p> Making tests for any Android application (I should say on any mobile application, but I've only seen Android and IOS) is a pain, and for a lot of reasons, including:</p> <ul class="org-ul"> <li>To test any android application you must have an android environment up and running. That means that the tests are going to be slow because they are going to run in a complete android environment (that can be a virtual machine, an emulator or a real device). <p> It also means that you have to get several environment (android version and devices) to test your application, because even with the same version of Android the execution can be quite different between on device and another (you find differences even between one device emulator and the real device!).</p> <p> Only this can make the tests veeeeeery slow.</p> </li> <li>The test is a different project running in a different process. This means that the test have to compile against the project, so every change on the project lead to a clean and recompilation of all the tests. That's because ant is not so good as Makefile checking the dependencies of each file (at least by default in the Android projects, I supose it can be quite better if you customize it to resolve all your dependencies, but this is not the usual). Sometimes even I uninstall all the test project in order to delete from the emulator some garbage that adb/android didn't delete at the reinstallation. <p> This also means that the test is responsible of running up the applicatiion, set up all the parameters you need and shut down the application. This is not bad, but I think the Android sdk should include a testing environment capable of setting up and down the application by you, so you don't have to do it in each test.</p> <p> Also, you have to know what actions have to be done at the test process and what actions should be done at the application process (or wait until the android test run an exception telling you that you have to run some action in the application process).</p> <p> Finally, if your application depends on an external application (like the gallery or an email application) it's almost impossible to test this part of the application, because you can test and control the application (or process) that you are developing, not an external application, so in some cases there are parts of you application impossible to test, because it's not possible (at least I didn't found how) to simulate an external calling.</p> </li> <li>The documentation about testing is risible. Appart of some basic documentation and examples at the official <a href="https://developer.android.com/">android developers page</a> there isn't any documentation of quality about the testing process, so it's very hard to learn how the tests works and to make a good testsuite of your Android application. I've found some posts that even recommend you to test your application directly on the physical device :). </li> </ul> <p> For this reasons in the next few days I'm going to make a little tutorial about how to make some tests to your Android application</p> <p> <b>To be continued&#x2026;</b></p> ]]></content:encoded> <dc:date>2012-05-01T21:45:00-05:00</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>Coconet 1.0.2 is out!</title> <link>http://blog.ritho.net/2012/05/01/coconet-1.0.2/</link> <description><![CDATA[ Hi all! ]]></description> <pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2012 16:51:00 -0500</pubDate> <guid>http://blog.ritho.net/2012/05/01/coconet-1.0.2/</guid> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Hi all!</p> <p> We have a new release of Coconet, in this case the version 1.0.2.

In fact, the company work closely with the CyanogenMod group, so there is no problem to install new updates of the phone from the Cyanogen ROM application.</p> <p> Happy Hacking!</p> ]]></content:encoded> <dc:date>2012-01-24T17:15:00-06:00</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>RIP</title> <link>http://blog.ritho.net/2011/10/30/RIP/</link> <description><![CDATA[ As you may now by now, this month had passed out three important figures in the Computer Science world: Steve Jobs, Dennis Ritchie and John McCarthy. ]]></description> <pubDate>Sun, 30 Oct 2011 03:47:00 -0600</pubDate> <guid>http://blog.ritho.net/2011/10/30/RIP/</guid> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> As you may now by now, this month had passed out three important figures in the Computer Science world: Steve Jobs, Dennis Ritchie and John McCarthy.</p> <p> Steve Jobs is the most famous of them by the general public, but, at the same time, the less influential in the Computer Science world. His most important achieve has been to change the perception and use of the technology of a lot of people. He was capable of innovate and connect with the general public, but, in my point of view, he was wrong about oe essential thing, the openness of his products. During all his career, and specially during his last years, he has managed his products in a closed way (he even didn't want to open the apple market to independent developers!) and I think he has missed the opportunity to really change the world if he would made free (as in freedom) at least any of his products.</p> <p> Dennis Ritchie, as many of the articles has said about him, is one of the original hackers. His great contribution (with other hackers) to our world include the C programming language (probably the most used programming language of all the times) and the Unix Operating System (the same used by apple to develop Mac OS and used as a reference by Richard M. Stallman and Linus Torvalds to develop GNU/Linux). This is a perfect example of how a free software can influence in the world (remember that Unix, at the beginnig, was open, and was after its success when companies and organizations started to launch his own closed version of Unix).</p> <p> The last one that have passed out is John McCarthy, creator of the Lisp programming language and of the term Artificial Intelligence. The Lisp programming language is less used than the C programming language, but it has been the most used programming language in Artificial Intelligence, in wich he is one of the major contributors. He also was the first to publicly suggest that computer time-sharing technology might lead to a future in which computing power and even specific applications could be sold through the utility business model.</p> <p> We're going to miss them and we'll try to continue their work the better we can.</p> <p> RIP</p> ]]></content:encoded> <dc:date>2011-10-30T03:47:00-06:00</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>#SpanishRevolution, part III</title> <link>http://blog.ritho.net/2011/10/10/Spanish-Revolution-III/</link> <description><![CDATA[ In the second part of this post I've explained the recent history and evolution of the social movements in Spain.

In this post I'm going to focus in #15m (or Indignados) movement, how they've started, their proposals, things that, <b>IMHO</b>, they've done well, things to improve and where they should go.</p> <p> As I said in my previous post, Indignados movement has been influenced by the #nolesvotes movement, which shows both how to self-organize in a global way (the opposite of the traditional social movements has done historically, working at a neighborhood level or, at best, at a city level) and how the new technologies can help in this self-organization, but, obviously, it's not the only movement that has influenced to #15M.</p> <p> In recent years the social movements in Spain have seen a revival in grassroots organization, whose work in the neighborhoods has been an essential breeding ground for movement #15M. These grassroots organizations have a participatory democracy based on people's assemblies and consensus decision making. These horizontally structured assemblies are completely transparent and open to anyone who wants to participate. The groundwork has served not only to learn work techniques and methodologies assemblies, but also enabled them to know the people, know their concerns and problems and know how to work with them.</p> <p> Therefore, having these two movements as parents it's not strange how quickly this movement has emerged and spread throughout all the country, in a way that only a few people could imagine.</p> <p> On January 2011, the digital platform Democracia real YA (one of the main actors in #15M movement) was created on Spanish social networks and forums. Having the support of organisations such as ATTAC, Intermon Oxfam, Ecologists in Action or Youth without Future, and using Twitter and Facebook it called "the unemployed, poorly paid, the subcontractors, the precarious, young people&#x2026;" to take the streets on 15 May in almost every city in Spain (you have at Wikipedia a comprehensive list of all the places that were called to take the streets on that day). That same day, small demonstrations in support of the Spanish ones were organised in Dublin, Lisbon, Amsterdam, Istanbul, Bologna, London and Paris.</p> <p> The first protest was called under the motto "we are not goods in the hands of politicians and bankers" and was focused on opposition to what the protesters called "antisocial means in the hands of bankers", partly referring to the changes made in 2010 to contain the ongoing European sovereign debt crisis through bailout of the banks, which the Spanish society saw as responsible for the crisis, while at the same time the government kept announcing social program cutbacks. Protesters also demanded more democracy, a new electoral law and end to political corruption as well as other claims, such as banks nationalisation.</p> <p> The main demand of #15M is a radical change in Spanish politics, and, although #15M is a heterogeneous and ambiguous group, they share a strong rejection of unemployment, welfare cuts, Spanish politicians, the current two-party system in Spain between the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party and the People's Party, as well as the current political system, capitalism, banks and bankers, political corruption and firmly support what they call basic rights: home, work, culture, health and education.</p> <p> As #nolesvotes, they don't consider themselves to be represented by any traditional party nor favoured by the measures approved by politicians. If you want to know more about the #15M proposals and actions you can visit their <a href="http://movimiento15m.org/">official page</a> and read their <a href="http://movimiento15m.org/manifiesto-movimiento-15m-%C2%A1democracia-real-ya/#more-5">manifesto</a>.</p> <p> The impact of #15M has been bigger than anyone thought, because according to statistics published by RTVE (the Spanish public broadcasting company) between 6.5 and 8 million Spaniards have participated in these protests, an unthinkable thing at the beginning of the year, and in this kind of things you can't trust the official information, so probably the participation has been even more.</p> <p> I think the most important thing that this movement has made is to make the spanish population aware that we can change the actual situation of our country, because a lot of people didn't think they can do something to make a change.</p> <p> Also, I think that #15M can have a life much longer than much people can imagine, from one side because the changes they are proposing are big ones, and they need time to define both the changes we have to make to have a fairly society and the strategy to make this changes possible, and from the other side because they have reach a big impact in the population, a lot of people has been a part of #15M, and being part of a movement like this makes you feel that your contribution is important, and, although sometimes you can desperate, this is a feeling that once you have it you want to keep it.</p> <p> Seeing the movement from the outside (although I wanted to involve myself in the movement I couldn't find the time until now) I think that sometimes they've enter in the politician's game more than they needs, but, obviously, it's a new and complex situation to handle and it can't be perfect.</p> <p> The movement has passed some critical times and situations (like the time after the local elections or the Pope visit), and they'll going to pass some more critical situations, but I think that the most important one is to handle the people's mood (it's a long path and a lot of people can desperate).</p> <p> Finally, although the movement can end in nothing, I think that the process is very important, not only because we're trying to change important thinks, but also because we are changing the point of view of a lot of people that, until now, they didn't realize they can make a change, and this is the seed of future revolutions.</p> <p> Happy Hacking!</p> <p> P.D.: You can access to information about the 15-M movement at the wikipedia <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/es/wiki/Movimiento_15-M">here</a>, <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/es/wiki/15M">here</a> (in spanish) and <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/2011_Spanish_protests">here</a> (in english).</p> <p> P.P.D.: All the ideas I expose here are personal opinions, comming only from myself, and here I don't represent any of the organizations I belong to.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <dc:date>2011-10-10T00:22:00-05:00</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>Org2blog, la herramienta de emacs para bloguear</title> <link>http://blog.ritho.net/2011/09/14/org2blog-es/</link> <description><![CDATA[ ¡Buenas a todos desde Brasil! ]]></description> <pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2011 19:41:00 -0500</pubDate> <guid>http://blog.ritho.net/2011/09/14/org2blog-es/</guid> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> ¡Buenas a todos desde Brasil!</p> <p> Hace algunos días descubrí una herramienta que me puede ayudar a bloguear con bastante más frecuencia, Org2Blog. Es básicamente un plugin del paquete org para publicar posts desde ficheros org con emacs. No he usado anteriormente org-mode, asi que he estado investigando un poco y he podido comprobar que no es sólo un paquete para publicar entradas en el blog, sino que además es una herramienta para administrar tu agenda y tu lista de cosas poor hacer, así que he estado unos días configurándolo y me da la impresión de que lo voy a usar bastante y me va a ser de gran ayuda.</p> <p> La parte de blog parece ser bastante sencilla, porque puedes definir el post con unas cuantas etiquetas sencillas de recordar y no define ningún formato extraño para escribir el post (como hacen muchos wikis). Tu sólo te tienes que ocupar de escribir el post en texto <b>plano</b> y el paquete se las arregla para convertirlo en tu entrada html.</p> <p> Aunque creo que se puede usar para otros blogs distintos de Wordpress, te recomiendo que mires que paquete funciona mejor para tu blog (por ejemplo, para blogger hay un paquete que parece funcionar mejor que este) antes de intentar volverte loco configurando este.</p> <p> Una de las cosas que quiero probar en los próximos días es la integración con Atom, ya que esa integración se hace con otro paquete y hasta ahora no he conseguido hacerlo funcionar.</p> <p> Espero poder bloguear mucho mas con esta herramienta, porque una de las cosas que odio de los blogs es tener que estar conectado y con un navegador abierto para escribir una entrada.</p> <p> Happy Hacking!</p> ]]></content:encoded> <dc:date>2011-09-14T19:41:00-05:00</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>Org2blog, the emacs blogging experience</title> <link>http://blog.ritho.net/2011/09/14/org2blog-en/</link> <description><![CDATA[ Hi from Brasil! ]]></description> <pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2011 19:41:00 -0500</pubDate> <guid>http://blog.ritho.net/2011/09/14/org2blog-en/</guid> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Hi from Brasil!</p> <p> Some days ago I've discovered a tool that can help me to blog more frequently, Org2Blog. It's basically a plugin for the org package to publish posts from org files in emacs. I didn't used previously org-mode, so I've investigated a bit about it and I found that I can use it not only for blog posting, but also to manage your agenda and todo list, so I've configured it out and I think I'm going to use it a lot.</p> <p> The blogging part seems to be pretty easy, because you can define your post entry with a few and easy to remember tags and it doesn't define any weird format to write (like a lot of wiki pages). You only have to write your post in <b>plain</b> text and the package manage to convert it to your html entry.</p> <p> Although I think you can use it not only for Wordpress, I recomend you to search for other packages if you're using other blog engine (for example, there is a package that works better with blogger that seems to work better than this one).</p> <p> One of the thinks that I want to try in the next few days is the integration of org2blog with atom. This integration is made by other package and I couldn't do it work in the last days.</p> <p> I hope to blog much more with this tool, cause one of the things that I hate of blogging is the necessity of being connected and with a browser opened to post an entry.</p> <p> Happy Hacking!</p> ]]></content:encoded> <dc:date>2011-09-14T19:41:00-05:00</dc:date> </item> <item> <title>#SpanishRevolution, part II</title> <link>http://blog.ritho.net/2011/09/14/Spanish-Revolution-II/</link> <description><![CDATA[ In the first part of this post I've explained the economical situation of Spain and how we've reached this situation.

Now it's the turn to explain a little bit the origins of the Indignados movement ant the recent history of the social movements in Spain.</p> <p> The Indignados movement (or #15M) born officially the 15 of May of 2011, although I think the real begining started before. In order to understand better the origins of the #15M it's better to explain a little bit the recent phistory of the social movements in Spain.</p> <p> As you might know, before the actual democracy Spain was headed by Francisco Franco, a dictator aligned ideologically with Hitler. Some years before his dead (1975) the social movements in Spain begans to be very strong, and, although they had to be subversive (the government was very represive even after the dead of Franco), they gain a lot of popularity, specially in the young people.</p> <p> After 1975 and during the 80's Spain became into a cultural and political revolution, and a lot of political parties (included PSOE and the Comunist Party) and labor unions (CCOO, UGT, CNT, &#x2026;) were legalized. This was the golden epoch of the social movements in Spain, because a lot of people were conscious that it was important to be part of the (not only) political change that was happening in Spain and, a very important thing, they were a part of this changes, in part because the government were taking them into consideration and making changes in the way the social movements were saying.</p> <p> After that, during the final 80s and the 90s the political parties forgot about the people and began to govern for themselves and for the "markets" (a.k.a the rich people) and the social movements began to accommodate, partially because the social situation were much better than during the dictatorial period and partially because some state mechanisms made the social movements too dependents from the government charity, and in the moment that any organization depends on the government it has to do some things and leave to do other things to please them and survive.</p> <p> I think that the reaction to this circumstances come both from a new social movement surged in Spain (and in the world :)), the Free Software movement, that has become very strong sice the final 90s, and from the deterioration of the spanish life style, specially with the actual crisis environment.</p> <p> In the last years we've seen here in Spain a lot of movement against the software patents in Europe and agains some copyright laws that have emerged in the last years in Spain, and a big part of this movement has been lead by hacktivist that have been participated in the Free Software movement during several years.</p> <p> This movements have been organized dinamically, without a need of a phisical organization, and in several times during a specific period of time. This has made that the state, with his old mechanisms of working, couldn't stop this kind of organization, that have made the enough noise to influence again in the political life of the country and in the spanish people.</p> <p> This was the kind of organization of #nolesvotes, the father of the #15m (or indignados) movement, who asks to vote in the municipal elections to any party but PSOE or PP, rised after the approval of an unfair copyright law by the two main political parties of Spain. Because of that #nolesvotes gained the support and/or comprehension of the population, being, in my point of view, a big success.</p> <p> To be continued&#x2026;</p> ]]></content:encoded> <dc:date>2011-09-14T02:10:00-05:00</dc:date> </item> <dc:date>2017-02-25T10:20:00-06:00</dc:date> </channel> </rss>
