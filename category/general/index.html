  <p> This year has come with an important change in my working side. In mid January I've finished my work relationship with Zaleos, and, since the beginning of March, I've started working at Lana. </p> <p> As you know, in May I decided to come back to Spain, and I had to thank the opportunity to Zaleos. I have learned a lot in Zaleos during the time I've worked there,...

  <p> Hi all, </p> <p> After more than three and a half years in Mexico working at Segundamano Mexico, I've decided to accept an offer from <a href="https://www.zaleos.net/">Zaleos</a> and come back to Spain.

  <p> Hi all!</p> <p> I'm back from South America (I've been 6 weeks in Chile and Argentina) with some good and bad news. The bad new is that I've been stolen and I don't have anymore some of my technical stuff, like a laptop, an external hard drive, a tablet and some other things. I've also lost some information, specially documentation and some projects of my studies and previous works.</p>...
