  This year has come with an important change in my working side. In mid January I've finished my work relationship with Zaleos, and, since the beginning of March, I've started working at Lana. As you know, in May I decided to come back to Spain, and I had to thank the opportunity to Zaleos. I have learned a lot in Zaleos during the time I've worked there, and I think...

  Hi all, After more than three and a half years in Mexico working at Segundamano Mexico, I've decided to accept an offer from Zaleos and come back to Spain. As you may know, I've been working at Schibsted (the company that owns Segundamano) for eight years, first in Madrid for four years and a half approximately and later in Mexico City for the last three and a half years,.

  Every time I have the chance of programming in Perl, I enjoy it more and more because it's a language that adapts to my needs very easily. Sometimes I want to create a module to reuse the functionality that repeats over and over in my Perl scripts. Still, until not long ago, I have never known how to prepare my Perl modules to build and install them easily in my...

  Short after I came into Mexico to work, in December 2015, I found a project in Crowd Supply for a new keyboard that draws my attention, the Ultimate Hacking Keyboard (a.k.a UHK), and I decided to buy one. The characteristics that impressed me the most were that it was a mechanical keyboard (I'm a fan of mechanical keyboards) and, more important, it could split into two halves. After a long...

  I've recently assisted to a O'Reilly training sessions in Safari about Kubernetes and my first impression about the tool is quite good, so I want to review the things I've liked more and the things I miss. For those you don't know, Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It works natively with Docker to make easy both to deploy new versions of...
