Hi all!

First of all, please apologize for not publishing anything in three
months, but both because of work (with several travels in the middle)
and personal projects I didn't have so much time to write.

To celebrate my birthday (I'm 30!!!!) I'm going to write a review of
my new cell phone, the [[http://www.geeksphone.com/es/moviles/zero/][Geekphone Zero]]. I got the phone at christmas
and I've to say that I'm very happy with it, because it works pretty
well (with some minor bugs related to the version of Android I'm
using), having a great quality/price rate.

Its price is 165 euros free (without a phone company contract), a
reasonable price to a smartphone with Android (a high-end smartphone
cost perfectly 400-500 euros free), and with all your basics
covered (wifi, usb, bluetooth, gps, ...) and, with the last version of
Android 2.3, it goes pretty smooth.

One of the major advantages of the phone is that you have root access,
so you can update it without losing the warranty. In fact, the company
work closely with the CyanogenMod group, so there is no problem to
install new updates of the phone from the Cyanogen ROM application.

Happy Hacking!
