Hi all,

Some days ago the GNU project got 30 years, and, thinking about all the things
that GNU and the free software have given to us I think it's time to give them
a present. It doesn't have to be money (although they deserve it), but some code,
an article, an speech explaining the virtues of the free software, or even
installing a free software to a friend or a family member.

In my case, I'm going to renew my membership to fsfeurope and I'm going to
publish as free software a project that I'm doing with some partners. And you?
Are you going to give a present to GNU/fsf?

Happy Hacking
