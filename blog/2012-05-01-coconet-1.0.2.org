Hi all!

We have a new release of Coconet, in this case the version  1.0.2. In
this step I've finished the translations into english of all the code
(global variables, functions and structs) and I've made some extra
optimizations of the code (nothing important).

In the next days/weeks (I've to work and to advance in other
projects :)) I'm going to port the project compilation process to
autoconf and automake. I want also to start the refactoring of the
code to remove at least some of the global variables and make some
more important optimizations of it.

If you want to try the latest stable version you can download it from
[[https://github.com/i02sopop/coconet/tarball/v1.0.2][here]], and if you want to checkout the code from the repository and
collaborate with me please visit the [[https://github.com/i02sopop/coconet][github repository page]].

Happy Hacking!!!
