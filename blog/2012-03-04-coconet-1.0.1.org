Hi all!

Today (well, actually yesterday :)) I've launched Coconet 1.0.1, the
first step to modernize my ending project at the University. In this
first step I've translated the comments and part of the code (it left
the functions name and the data structures) into english and I've made
some little optimizations. I've also structured a little bit the
project, but I've to add some additional information.

My next steps are finishing the translation of all the code, make a
review of all the code to enhace the design and optimize it, port the
build of the project to autoconf and automake and make a simple web
page of the project containing its basic information, some links to
download the code (as a package and from the repository), ...

If you want to try the latest stable version you can download it from
[[https://github.com/i02sopop/coconet/tarball/v1.0.1][here]], and if
you want to checkout the code from the repository and collaborate with
me please visit the [[https://github.com/i02sopop/coconet][github
repository page]].

Happy Hacking!!!
