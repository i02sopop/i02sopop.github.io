Hi all!

I know it hass been more than a year without writing anything, but, between my
absorving work and the fact that I'm not really good with the written world (and
a little bit of lazyness, why no admit it), I didn't found the time to dedicate
to the blog.

Now I'm not going to give promises, but I'm going to try it hard to write at least
one post per week, and who knows, maybe once I've started to write I can write
more often and more fluently.

Well, you'll have notices from me during this week.

Happy Hacking!
